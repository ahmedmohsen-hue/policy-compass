## ðŸš¨ Solving the Arabic 404 Error

If you're getting a 404 error when accessing the Arabic version (`/ar/index.html`), follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Verify Repository Settings**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Ensure **Source** is set to "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### **Step 2: Check File Structure**
Your repository should look like this:
```
your-repo-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main English page
â”œâ”€â”€ ar/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html          # Arabic page
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ premium-style.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ arabic-style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ premium-script.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ arabic-script.js
â””â”€â”€ .nojekyll               # Important for GitHub Pages
```

### **Step 3: Force GitHub to Recognize Subdirectories**
The `.nojekyll` files have been added to prevent GitHub from ignoring the `/ar/` directory.

### **Step 4: Test the URLs**
Once deployed, your URLs should be:
- **English**: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`
- **Arabic**: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/ar/`

### **Step 5: Wait for Deployment**
- GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update
- Check the **Actions** tab in your repository to see deployment status
- Look for a green checkmark indicating successful deployment

### **Step 6: Clear Browser Cache**
If still not working:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try accessing the Arabic URL directly
3. Try in an incognito/private window

### **Alternative Solution: Custom Domain**
If you're using a custom domain, ensure your DNS settings include:
- A record pointing to GitHub Pages IPs
- CNAME file in repository root with your domain name

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Repository is public or GitHub Pro account for private Pages
- [ ] Pages is enabled in repository settings
- [ ] Source branch is correctly selected (main/master)
- [ ] .nojekyll file exists in root
- [ ] File paths use correct casing (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Wait 10 minutes after any changes
- [ ] Browser cache cleared

## ðŸ“ž Additional Help
If the issue persists, the problem is likely:
1. **Repository visibility**: Pages requires public repos on free accounts
2. **File permissions**: Ensure files are committed and pushed properly
3. **Branch settings**: Double-check the source branch in Pages settings

The bilingual system is correctly implemented - it's just a deployment configuration issue that these steps will resolve.
